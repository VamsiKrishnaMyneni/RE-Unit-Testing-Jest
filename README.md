Sure! Here's a clean and concise **README** section for the **Testing** part of your project, covering **E2E**, **Integration**, and **Unit Testing**:

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Our project uses a combination of **Unit**, **Integration**, and **End-to-End (E2E)** testing to ensure code reliability, maintainability, and overall application stability.

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Unit Testing
- **Purpose**: Test individual functions or components in isolation.
- **Tools**: Jest, Testing Library (React Testing Library for UI components).
- **Example**: Verifying a function returns the expected output given specific inputs.

```bash
npm run test
```

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Integration Testing
- **Purpose**: Test interactions between multiple units/modules.
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library.
- **Example**: Testing a form component that interacts with multiple child components and APIs.

```bash
npm run test
```

### ðŸ”¹ 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Purpose**: Simulate real user scenarios and test the full application flow.
- **Tools**: Cypress / Playwright.
- **Example**: Logging in, navigating to a page, and performing user actions.

```bash
# For Cypress
npx cypress open

# Or for Playwright
npx playwright test
```

# TDD (Test Driven Development)
TDD is a software development practice where tests are written even before the code is written.

Once the tests are written the code is written to ensure the tests are passed.
