 ## ðŸ§ª Testing

Our project uses a combination of **Unit**, **Integration**, and **End-to-End (E2E)** testing to ensure code reliability, maintainability, and overall application stability.

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Unit Testing
- **Purpose**: Test individual functions or components in isolation.
- **Tools**: Jest, Testing Library (React Testing Library for UI components).
- **Example**: Verifying a function returns the expected output given specific inputs.

```bash
npm run test
```

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Integration Testing
- **Purpose**: Test interactions between multiple units/modules.
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library.
- **Example**: Testing a form component that interacts with multiple child components and APIs.

```bash
npm run test
```

### ðŸ”¹ 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Purpose**: Simulate real user scenarios and test the full application flow.
- **Tools**: Cypress / Playwright.
- **Example**: Logging in, navigating to a page, and performing user actions.

```bash
# For Cypress
npx cypress open

# Or for Playwright
npx playwright test
```

### âœ… Best Practices
- Write tests for new features before or during development.
- Keep tests deterministic and independent.
- Use mocks/stubs where external services are involved.
- Continuously monitor test coverage and aim for meaningful assertions.
